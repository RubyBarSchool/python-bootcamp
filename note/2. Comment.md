- Comments starts with a #

```
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

- Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
 
```
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```

# Multiline Comments

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
