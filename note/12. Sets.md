# Sets
```
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```
## Set
- Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
- A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
- Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
```
- Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
### Set Items
- Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
### Unordered
- Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

- Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
### Unchangeable
- Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

- Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.
### Duplicates Not Allowed
-Sets cannot have two items with the same value.

- Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:
- Note: The values False and 0 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:
### Get the Length of a Set
- To determine how many items a set has, use the len() function.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print(len(thisset))
```
### Set Items - Data Types
- Set items can be of any data type:
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
set3 = {True, False, False}
```
- A set can contain different data types:
```
set1 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}

```
### type()
- From Python's perspective, sets are defined as objects with the data type 'set':
```
<class 'set'>

myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(type(myset))
```
### The set() Constructor
- It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.
```
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thisset)
```
## Access Set Items
### Access Items
- You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.

- But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)
```
### Change Items

- Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.

## Add Set Items
### Add Items
- Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
- To add one item to a set use the add() method.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.add("orange")

print(thisset)
```
### Add Sets
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}

thisset.update(tropical)

print(thisset)
```
### Add Any Iterable
- The object in the update() method does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object (tuples, lists, dictionaries etc.).
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"]

thisset.update(mylist)

print(thisset)
```
## Remove Set Items
### Remove Item
- To remove an item in a set, use the remove(), or the discard() method.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.remove("banana")

print(thisset)
```
- Note: If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.discard("banana")

print(thisset)
```
- Note: If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.

- You can also use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will remove a random item, so you cannot be sure what item that gets removed.

- The return value of the pop() method is the removed item.

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

x = thisset.pop()

print(x)

print(thisset)
```
- Note: Sets are unordered, so when using the pop() method, you do not know which item that gets removed.
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.clear()

print(thisset)



thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

del thisset

print(thisset)
```
## Loop Sets
### Loop Items
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)
```
## Join Sets
- There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.

- The union() and update() methods joins all items from both sets.

- The intersection() method keeps ONLY the duplicates.

- The difference() method keeps the items from the first set that are not in the other set(s).

- The symmetric_difference() method keeps all items EXCEPT the duplicates.

### Union
```
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)
```
- You can use the | operator instead of the union() method, and you will get the same result.

```
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1 | set2
print(set3)
```
### Join Multiple Sets
- All the joining methods and operators can be used to join multiple sets.

- When using a method, just add more sets in the parentheses, separated by commas:
```
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = {"John", "Elena"}
set4 = {"apple", "bananas", "cherry"}

myset = set1.union(set2, set3, set4)
print(myset)
```
- When using the | operator, separate the sets with more | operators:
```
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = {"John", "Elena"}
set4 = {"apple", "bananas", "cherry"}

myset = set1 | set2 | set3 |set4
print(myset)
```
### Join a Set and a Tuple
- The union() method allows you to join a set with other data types, like lists or tuples.

- The result will be a set.

```
x = {"a", "b", "c"}
y = (1, 2, 3)

z = x.union(y)
print(z)
```
- Note: The  | operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the  union() method.
### Update
- The update() method inserts all items from one set into another.

- The update() changes the original set, and does not return a new set.
```
set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set1.update(set2)
print(set1)
```
- Note: Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.
### Intersection
- Keep ONLY the duplicates

- The intersection() method will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
print(set3)
```
- You can use the & operator instead of the intersection() method, and you will get the same result.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1 & set2
print(set3)
```
- Note: The & operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the intersection() method.
- The intersection_update() method will also keep ONLY the duplicates, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set1.intersection_update(set2)

print(set1)
```
- The values True and 1 are considered the same value. The same goes for False and 0.

```
set1 = {"apple", 1,  "banana", 0, "cherry"}
set2 = {False, "google", 1, "apple", 2, True}

set3 = set1.intersection(set2)

print(set3)
```
### Difference
- The difference() method will return a new set that will contain only the items from the first set that are not present in the other set.

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1.difference(set2)

print(set3)
```
- You can use the - operator instead of the difference() method, and you will get the same result.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1 - set2
print(set3)
```
- Note: The - operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the difference() method.

- The difference_update() method will also keep the items from the first set that are not in the other set, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set1.difference_update(set2)

print(set1)
```
### Symmetric Differences
- The symmetric_difference() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

print(set3)
```
- You can use the ^ operator instead of the symmetric_difference() method, and you will get the same result.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1 ^ set2
print(set3)
```
- Note: The ^ operator only allows you to join sets with sets, and not with other data types like you can with the symmetric_difference() method.
- The symmetric_difference_update() method will also keep all but the duplicates, but it will change the original set instead of returning a new set.
```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set1.symmetric_difference_update(set2)

print(set1)
```
