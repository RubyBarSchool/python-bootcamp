Let's plan a robust refactor for your Blackjack game in prj_copilot_refactor.py. The current code has several issues and opportunities for improvement:
Problems and Refactor Goals:
Global State: The use of global variables (user, computer, user_score, computer_score) makes the code error-prone and hard to maintain.
Deck Mutation: The scores() function mutates the global cards list, which is incorrect for a real deck and can cause bugs.
Game Logic: The winner calculation uses undeclared variables (u_score, c_score) and is not called correctly.
Function Responsibilities: Functions are not modular; some handle both I/O and logic.
Replay Logic: The replay loop is not cleanly separated from the game logic.
Deck Handling: The deck should be a fresh copy for each game, and cards should be removed as they are dealt (if simulating a real deck).
Testing and Robustness: The code should be easy to test and robust against edge cases.
Refactor Plan:
Remove all global variables except for constants (logo, initial cards).
Encapsulate the game state (user hand, computer hand, deck) in a class or pass as function arguments.
Fix the Ace handling logic so it only affects the hand, not the global deck.
Separate I/O from logic for easier testing.
Ensure the winner calculation uses the correct variables and is called at the right time.
Make the code modular and readable, with clear function responsibilities.
Ensure the deck is not mutated globally and is reset for each game.
Add docstrings and comments for clarity.
Now, I will implement these changes.
